Cyclohexanol (c1ccccc1O) is the organic compound with the formula (CH2)5CHOH.
The molecule is related to cyclohexane ring by replacement of one hydrogen atom by a hydroxyl group.[4]
This compound exists as a deliquescent colorless solid with a camphor-like odor, which, when very pure,
melts near room temperature. Billions of kilograms are produced annually, mainly as a precursor to nylon.

Aspirin (CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O)  also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a medication used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation.[3] Specific inflammatory conditions in which it is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly after a heart attack decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk.[3] Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.[4] For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes.[3] Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but it is also an antiplatelet and suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.

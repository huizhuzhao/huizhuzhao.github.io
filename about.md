I am an algorithm enginner at [Xtalpi](http://www.xtalpi.com), and currently focused on applying deeplearning to drug design.
I received my Master degree from Renmin University of China, where I worked with Prof. [Lei Wang](http://www.phys.ruc.edu.cn/contents/26/5.html) in the area of heat conduction in 1D lattice system. My interests are in machine learning, big data, and statistics.
